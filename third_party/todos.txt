(func pointer)
Need some type of function pointer to apply to channel/tree parsing galore!
  AST: Things are already nodes, so no need
  HTML Render: n-Dim string array ~ channelize! ~ turn from arrays to string!

    [Title],

Channelize/ProcessConcurrently(tree/struct, func pointer to apply to each ~):
  if s.HasChildren():
    ch := (make chan len(s.children))
    for c in range(s.children):
      ch <= ProcessConcurrently(c, func pointer)
    Merge() # render only logic

  # apply formatting
  s.content = func pointer(s.type)
  # tricky cuz you need block separation by 2 spaces, no?
